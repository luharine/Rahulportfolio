           <P>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
                and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has bee
                n the industry's standard dummy text ever since
                 the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a 
                 galley of type and scrambled it to make a
                  type specimen book. It has survived not
                   only five centuries, but also the leap 
                   into electronic typesetting, remaining 
                   essentially unchanged. It was popularised 
                   in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                    sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
                     more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</P>
