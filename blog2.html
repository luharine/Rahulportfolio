        <p>There are many variations of passages of
            Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form,
            by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.
            If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
            anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators
            on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the
            first true generator on the Internet.</p>

        <h2> Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots</h2>

        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lor
            em Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
            classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a La
            tin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
            consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
            discovered the undoubtable source. </p>

        <h2>Incomprehensibility or readability?<small>from a Lorem Ipsum passage. </small></h2>
        <p>
            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I
            will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of
            the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
            because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
            consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
            pain of itself.
